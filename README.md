# Cloud Analytics with Azure
 Analyzing bike data set in json format using Azure Event hub and Stream Analytics.

 Hence, we created a name space for the deployment of the event hub.
 All event hub connection and data schema code was using visual studio.
 We used a 20 entries to be streamed through 50 events in a time interval of 2 sec.
